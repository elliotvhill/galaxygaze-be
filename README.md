# GalazyGaze _(front end)_

## Description
An astronomy planning app built using the open [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and [Astronomy API](https://astronomyapi.com/). Users will use the app to check stargazing conditions in their area, and can set up to be notified when conditions meet their criteria. They can also learn about and get alerts about astronomical events like full moons, meteor showers, etc.

Users will be able to log in and create a profile, share posts about their observations, and add/follow friends.
